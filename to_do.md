# To-do

1) Update movie/rating details - Because might be possible that certain details are not recorded properly or wrong information has been stored. Time Constraint.
2) Delete movie/rating - Because might be possible that certain details are not supposed to be added or wrongly added. Time Constraint.
3) Enhancement into category field - Because current solution is only focused on best picture but there are several more categories in the oscar e.g. Actor, Actress,
   Supporting Actor so on. Time Constraint.
4) Adding more test cases in JUnit e.g. save rating, findByMovieTitle, comparing the RequestBody of each request. Time Constraint. Save Rating I have tried from my end but some how its not working. Invested time but didn't include it due to time constraint.
5) I would have used MySQL instead of in built h2 memory database. Time constraint. But I have design the system in such a way that you just need to change the configuration inside
   application.properties file under path src/main/resource and application will run with MySQL database.
